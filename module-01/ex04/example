Flu medication for government employees

A specific vaccine for humans effective in preventing avian influenza is not
yet readily available. Based on limited data, the CDC suggested that the
anti-viral medication Oseltamivir (brand name-Tamiflu) may be effective in
treating avian influenza. Using this input, the Department of State decided to
pre-position the drug Tamiflu at its Embassies and Consulates worldwide, for
eligible U.S. Government employees and their families serving abroad who become
ill with avian influenza.

Flu medication for private citizens

We emphasize that we can’t make this medication available to private U.S.
citizens abroad. Because of this, and because Tamiflu may not be readily
available overseas, the State Department encourages American citizens traveling
or living abroad to consult with their private physician about whether to get
Tamiflu before they travel, whether to use if treatment becomes necessary, or
if Tamiflu is readily available in the country where they live.

Counterfeit drug warning

Americans should also be aware of the potential health risk posed by
counterfeit drugs, including those represented as Tamiflu, by internet scam
artists or in countries with lax regulations governing the production and
distribution of pharmaceuticals.

Additional precautions

In addition, the Department of State has asked its embassies and consulates to
consider preparedness measures that consider that travel into or out of a
country may not be possible, safe or medically advisable. Guidance on how
private citizens can prepare for a “stay in place” response, including
stockpiling food, water, and medical supplies, is available on the CDC and
pandemicflu.gov websites.
